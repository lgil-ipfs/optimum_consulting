                <p>It’s not unusual for people to occasionally experience difficulty navigating stressful events or
                    challenging circumstances in their lives, which can put strain on careers, relationships, and one’s
                    sense of competence and well-being. Working through such difficulty by opening up to someone close —
                    be it a family member, dear friend, or trusted colleague — can be difficult, if not impossible. I
                    can fill this role for you and help you reach your full potential.</p>
